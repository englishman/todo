TODO project
============================
Demo is available at **http://demo.todo.si**

Project's main goal is a better personal organisation. You can write your tasks and set reminders for them via email, sms and in the future releases via Google GCM.
The project was started as seminar work for faculty and it's written in almost three days so it's not an example of beauty. **Currently it is including SQL injections so please, be one and the only user over BASIC authentication.** Plan is to rewrite back end to Python (Django framework), currently it's written in PHP.

Installation for Ubuntu can be done using install.sh file. Carefully look at it and change it as necessary (variables for database credentials..).
You can deploy project by:

  # bash install.sh
  
You can access the project with url:
http://localhost
